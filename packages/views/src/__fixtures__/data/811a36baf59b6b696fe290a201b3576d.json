They can be fried, roasted, grilled, steamed, or even cooked in the microwave. And they can be served as the main ingredient for a dish, or simply added as part of the mix. This makes mushrooms an ideal choice for creating absolutely delicious vegetarian dishes.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo let\u0027s take a look at some of our favorite types of mushroom. You might not have tried cooking with them before but don\u0027t let that put you off. With their delicious, distinctive flavors you can easily transform soups, starters, sauces and create amazing pasta, or stir-fry dishes.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETry the lovely \u003Cstrong\u003Eshiitake\u003C\/strong\u003E. Used in Asian cooking, these can be purchased dried and rehydrated for a strong, deep flavor. Or buy fresh and add to soups and stir-fries. Not only does this mushroom have an intense flavor, it looks lovely too. The deep brown and smooth shapes will provide texture to your meal. In their dried form and rehydrated, these are the perfect addition for a deep and flavorful stock for a risotto.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe gorgeous sunny \u003Cstrong\u003Echanterelle\u003C\/strong\u003E with its yellow flesh has a fruity flavor - but it is worth mentioning that there are many lookalikes out there and care should be taken to ensure you\u0027re eating the right ones. These look great in an omelette or an Asian soup to complement the yellow tones.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe brown \u003Cstrong\u003Emorel\u003C\/strong\u003E offers a meaty and distinctive flavor and you\u0027ll probably love how extraordinary they look in a meal. The morel is a more popular mushroom during the spring, when their availability is high.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor delicacy try the \u003Cstrong\u003Eenoki\u003C\/strong\u003E with its tiny white heads that grow in a bunch. These can even be eaten raw in salads. Finally, you can choose the popular \u003Cstrong\u003Eoyster\u003C\/strong\u003E mushroom. They are named thus because they look nothing like a mushroom and resemble the innards of an oyster and their sweet flavor is delicious.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",

Long gone are the days of stodgy breakfast bowls of thick gloop, because oats are getting served up as a delicious meal that can suit any time of the day. Trendy build-your-own oatmeal bars are popping up, and they are providing the ultimate oatmeal experience.

But if you simply soak your dried fruit in orange juice overnight, they develop a tang, and they swell up, making them softer and even more delicious.

Put your cooked oatmeal into a ramekin, sprinkle with sugar, and pop under the grill. The sugar will harden, giving you the delight of cracking through the surface and scooping out the creamy deliciousness beneath. If you are really professional, you can use a blow torch.\n\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003ESuper seeds\u003C\/h2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a more savory meal option, cook your oats with water, a little salt, and sprinkle with toasted seeds.
